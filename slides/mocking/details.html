<h2>Feature Request</h2>

<p>Our client wants a custom API endpoint that returns conference speakers from within the CMS. We need an API method that calls<code>get_speakers()</code>from the parent application.</p>

<p>We donâ€™t care how the application does it, we just need to know what<code>get_speakers()</code>looks like so we can mock it.</p>
